# Predicting and Analyzing Heart Disease with Machine Learning Algorithams

Nowadays, the majority of individuals are suffering from heart illness without any discernible cause. We are unable to provide the right cause for this uncertainty. So there are a variety of explanations for the socity, but cardiology physicians are also at an inexplicable point. Because the heart is such an important part of the body, it is difficult to treat a patient if something goes wrong with it. The power machine of the Bload circulation system is the heart. As a result, we must pay more attention to heart disease.


As a result, avoiding heart disease has become more important than ever. Good data-driven systems for predicting cardiac illnesses can help to enhance the overall research and preventive process, allowing more individuals to live a healthy lifestyle. This is where Machine Learning enters the picture. Machine Learning aids in the diagnosis of heart illnesses, and the results are quite accurate. The project included data processing and analysis of a heart disease patient dataset. Then, using various methods, several models were trained and predictions were created.

It uses binary classification machine learning methods (random forest, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, Naive Bayes) and a dataset of patient data from  UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository to model and predict the existence of heart disease in patients.

The project is divided into three separate Jupyter notebooks:

1. Data Analysis
2. Model - Model_K Nearest Neighbors,   
                   Model Random forest,  
                     Model Logistic Regression , 
                      Model Navie Bayes, 
4. Model Conclusions
